# Check matrix

Every automated check that runs across git hooks and CI, with its authoritative context and gating conditions. Tribunal includes the SvelteKit web application (`applications/web`), the review engine (`applications/engine`), the proxy (`applications/proxy`), the reviewer runner image (`runner`), and shared `@tribunal/*` packages (`packages/*`).

## Authoritative context policy

CI is the authoritative gate for all checks. Git hooks provide early, fast feedback but are skippable (e.g., `--no-verify`). A check must pass in CI before merging.

For on-demand full local validation, use `bun run verify`, which runs the repository gates sequentially with a pass/fail summary: lockfile sync, type check, format check, lint, `bun run db:check`, web server/client unit tests, review-engine coverage, web E2E tests, build, and migration consistency.

| Check                 | Authority       | Hook role                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lockfile sync         | CI              | `HOOKS_STRICT=1` pre-commit only                            |
| Prettier              | CI (full)       | Pre-commit formats staged files only via lint-staged        |
| ESLint                | CI (full)       | Pre-commit lints changed packages only via `turbo run lint` |
| Type check            | CI              | `HOOKS_STRICT=1` pre-push only                              |
| Unit tests            | CI (full)       | `HOOKS_STRICT=1` pre-commit only (`--changed --bail 1`)     |
| E2E tests             | CI              | No hook equivalent; included in `bun run verify`            |
| Build verification    | CI              | `HOOKS_STRICT=1` pre-push only                              |
| Migration consistency | CI + Pre-commit | Pre-commit when schema files staged; CI always              |
| Container images      | CI              | No hook equivalent                                          |

## CI job structure

CI runs seven jobs in parallel, gated by a single `ci-status` aggregation job:

| Job                | Steps                                                               | Notes                                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `type-check`       | `turbo run check` (with `--affected` on PRs)                        | 8GB heap; runs upstream builds via turbo graph |
| `lint-format`      | `format:check` + `turbo run lint` (with `--affected` on PRs)        | 8GB heap for ESLint                            |
| `test-unit`        | Package tests (`turbo run test`) + server unit tests                | Node environment only                          |
| `test-browser`     | Browser unit tests + web Playwright E2E tests + dev-server smoke    | Gated on browser-testable changes (PRs)        |
| `build`            | `turbo run build` (with `--affected` on PRs)                        | Placeholder `DATABASE_URL` for SvelteKit build |
| `migration`        | `db:check` + psql apply loop + structure verification + drift check | Postgres service container                     |
| `container-images` | Docker build, reviewer self-check, and injected-port boot smoke     | Requires GitHub Actions Docker daemon          |
| `ci-status`        | Aggregates all job results; fails if any job failed or cancelled    | Branch protection checks this single job       |

Change detection uses Turborepo's `--affected` flag (dependency-graph-aware) for `check`, `lint`, and `build`. The `test-browser` job uses inline `git diff` checks against the PR base so browser and E2E work only runs when relevant files change. On pushes to `main`, the gated browser job always runs.

The `migration` job applies every numbered SQL file in `packages/database/drizzle/` against a Postgres service container, verifies the resulting schema structure (table count and applied-file-count vs. the journal), and replays historical rename/missing-table scenarios to guard against regressions in migration ordering. It finishes with a drift check (`bun run --cwd packages/database check:migrations`) that fails if the committed migrations diverge from the schema definitions.

The `container-images` job builds the web, engine, proxy, and reviewer images. The reviewer image runs `runner/verify-image.mjs`, which checks system binaries and imports the runtime packages used by `runner/run-agent.mjs` (`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` and `@tribunal/agents`) before an agent run can fail later from a missing package.

The `Deploy Production` workflow is separate from CI. It is triggered by a
successful `CI` workflow run on `main`, publishes a fresh Tensorlake reviewer
image, applies production migrations with the direct Neon URL, deploys proxy,
engine, and web in dependency order, enforces one engine Machine, and runs the
production health gates from `documentation/deployment/containers.md`.

## Notes on CI separation

- **Prettier and ESLint are separate CI steps.** Running both in one process pushed ESLint over the runner's memory limit, so `bun run format:check` runs as a lightweight standalone step, separate from `turbo run lint` (which gets `--max-old-space-size=8192`). Each tool still runs exactly once.
- **`bun run check` runs `svelte-kit sync` first**, ensuring `.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json` exists before ESLint's TypeScript project service resolves the root `tsconfig.json`.

| File-gating (JS/TS/Svelte)  | Pre-push   | Skips type check / build if no relevant files changed                             |
| File-gating (schema)        | Pre-commit | Runs migration consistency only when `packages/database/src/schema/` files staged |
| Turbo `--affected`          | CI         | Limits `check`, `lint`, and `build` to packages affected by the PR's changes      |
| Inline `git diff` detection | CI         | Skips browser/E2E work when no relevant files change                              |
