 * check is effectively free. `/health/ready` and `/metrics` share one per-client
 * `operations` budget, so the bound holds across both.
 *
 * Fails **open** on a limiter error, like the public `/health` gate and for the
 * same reason: these are observability endpoints, and a rate-limiter (Redis)
 * outage must not blind an operator during the very incident they need `/metrics`
 * (in-memory, Redis-independent) and `/health/ready` to diagnose. The bearer
 * token remains the primary guard; the rate limit is defense-in-depth whose only
 * lapse is a window in which Redis — hence the store — is already down.
